This file is intended to track the development efforts of Sriram and Raghu.

The first major discussion about the project.  We discussed how we can share responsibilities - Raghu will initially take care of scrapping data
for the project and persisting it in a proper format while I(Sriram) will take care of developing the exoskeleton of the android app.

As with any major initiative that i've taken, this too fell at its face.  Raghu did his bit, but then i could not keep pace.  a lot of stuff happened
in the interim that prevented me from actively working on this.  hopefully, adding this log now is a sign of things to come.
